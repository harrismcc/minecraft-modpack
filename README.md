# About

Siim's Simple Create is a modpack centered around Create. The pack is designed to be easy to learn, and to include a minimal amount of content - meaning that it's tailored to my (siim's) use-case. However, I've made it available for others in case others share my preferences or want to use this pack as a starting point for their own.

Featured Mods include:

- [Create](<[https://modrinth.com/mod/create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create)>)
- [Supplementaries](https://modrinth.com/mod/supplementaries)
- [Forgero](https://modrinth.com/mod/forgero)
- [Terralith](https://modrinth.com/mod/terralith)
- [Tom's Simple Storage](https://modrinth.com/mod/toms-storage)
- [Traveler's Backpack](https://modrinth.com/mod/travelersbackpack)
- ...And More!
