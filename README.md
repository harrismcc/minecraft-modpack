# About

Siim's Simple Create is a modpack centered around Create. The pack is designed to be easy to learn, and to include a minimal amount of content - meaning that it's tailored to my (siim's) use-case. However, I've made it available for others in case others share my preferences or want to use this pack as a starting point for their own.

Featured Mods include:

- [Create](<[https://modrinth.com/mod/create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create)>)
- [Supplementaries](https://modrinth.com/mod/supplementaries)
- [Forgero](https://modrinth.com/mod/forgero)
- [Terralith](https://modrinth.com/mod/terralith)
- [Tom's Simple Storage](https://modrinth.com/mod/toms-storage)
- [Traveler's Backpack](https://modrinth.com/mod/travelersbackpack)
- ...And More!

# Contributing

If you notice issues while using the pack, or have suggestions for new mods or changes, feel free to [submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/harrismcc/minecraft-modpack/issues). I'll look through these periodically and make comments in the thread there.

# Using The Pack

This modpack is created using [packwiz](https://packwiz.infra.link/) which is able to manage the pack as code, and export it to both Modrinth and Forge.

You can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/harrismcc/minecraft-modpack/releases/latest). Use the file ending in `.mrpack` for modrinth, or the zip file for forge.

This pack is pending approval on Modrinth, but once approved it will be listed there and the latest version will be pushed there as well.
